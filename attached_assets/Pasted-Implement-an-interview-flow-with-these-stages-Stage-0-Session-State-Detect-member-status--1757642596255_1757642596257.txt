Implement an interview flow with these stages:

Stage 0: Session State
- Detect member.status ∈ {new, returning_incomplete, returning_complete}
- If new → Stage 1. If returning_incomplete → say “Welcome back—let’s finish your profile” and jump to the first incomplete section.
- If returning_complete → offer quick review + “Update anything?” If yes, branch to edits; if no, end.

Stage 1: Identity & Contact
- Legal name, preferred display name, pronouns (optional), headline (short “who I am”), city/region/timezone.
- Primary email, optional phone, social links (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, GitHub, personal site, portfolio).
- Visibility toggles for each handle.

Stage 2: Persona & Role
- Ask: “Which best describes you right now?” (multi-select allowed, but pick a primary)
  [VC / Angel / Family Office / Founder / Operator / Engineer / Designer / Product / Data/AI / Creator / Researcher / Student / Recruiter / Community/Events / Service Provider (legal/finance/marketing) / Other]
- If multiple, pick Primary Persona for routing.

Stage 3: Goals (pull intent clearly)
- “In one sentence: What are you looking for right now?” (free text; example: “I’m a VC looking for AI startups with proven founders.”)
- Choose 1–3 top goals from chips:
  - Raise capital / Invest capital / Hire / Find a cofounder / Find customers / Get a mentor / Find advisors / Find service providers / Join a startup / Partnership BD / Speaking & PR / Find a space (office/housing/event) / Community & events / Other

Stage 8: Review & Confirm
- Display a concise profile summary.
- Let user edit any section.
- Confirm to finalize → return JSON outputs.

Validation:
- Normalize tags (lowercase, kebab or snake).

- Respect all privacy flags in output.

Return:
